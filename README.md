# Spherical Pendulum 

by Jason Barbour

## The_Spherical_Pendulum_julia.ipynb

This notebook is a simple example of all the components for the spherical pendulum. The notebook is written in Julia.

## interactive_pendulum_Lz.jl

Running this file will get you an interactive plot of the spherical pendulum. The user can change the angular momentum of the pendulum and the energy, and the plot will update accordingly.

## interactive_pendulum.jl

Same as above, but the interactive inputs are $\theta$, $\dot{\theta}$, $\phi$, and $\dot{\phi}$.

## Multiple_init.jl

Running this file will get you an interactive plot of the phase space for multiple initial conditions.
